## My Concert Experience

This is a JavaScript React app written in Typescript using the Model View Controller pattern.  

This is a simple application intended to be a social media site, where users can keep track of concerts they have attended, read others concert posts, and comment on them.  The user also has the ability to delete and edit their own comments, as well as read all comments other users post.  This will be a really fun project when in its final version.  This is only version one.
